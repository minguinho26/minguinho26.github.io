### Hi, I'm minkyu kim 👋

I am an AI Researcher at [AITRICS](https://aitrics.com/kr/), where I specialize in multimodal learning and generative AI. My work focuses on developing advanced artificial intelligence models that integrate various data domains (such as images, text, and audio) to solve real-world challenges. My main goal remains to design AI that assists people in various situations.

Prior to joining AITRICS, I received my M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence from POSTECH in August 2025. During my time there, I was a member of the [POSTECH Efficient Learning Lab (EffL)](http://effl.postech.ac.kr) advised by [Prof. Jaeho Lee](https://jaeho-lee.github.io). I mainly focused on data compression, and my final project was on [text-guided image compression](https://taco-nic.github.io). My previous research experience also includes collaborations with [Prof. Tae-Hyun Oh](https://ami.kaist.ac.kr/members/tae-hyun-oh) on [audio captioning](https://prefixaac.github.io) and with [Prof. Sangpil Kim](https://kuaicv.com/professor/) on event-based photometric stereo.

I earned my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Chung-Ang University (CAU)](https://www.cau.ac.kr/index.do).

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
