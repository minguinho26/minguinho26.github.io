### Hi, I'm minkyu kim üëã
I'm a second-year M.S. student at [POSTECH Efficient Learning Lab (EffL)](http://effl.postech.ac.kr), advised by [Prof. Jaeho Lee](https://jaeho-lee.github.io). Before joining POSTECH, I completed my B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from [Chung-Ang University (CAU)](https://www.cau.ac.kr/).

My research interest lies in multimodal learning,¬†which trains artificial intelligence by using data from various domains (such as images, text, and audio) and uses it to solve multiple tasks.¬†Additionally, my main goal is to design artificial intelligence that assists people in various situations.

In EffL, I'm mainly focusing on data compression. My recent work is [text-guided image compression](https://taco-nic.github.io). I worked with [Prof. Tae-Hyun Oh](https://ami.postech.ac.kr/members/tae-hyun-oh) on [Audio Captioning](https://prefixaac.github.io), and with [Prof. Sangpil Kim](https://kuaicv.com/professor/) on the event-based photometric stereo.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
